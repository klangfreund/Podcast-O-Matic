  Debian/Ubuntu users will need:
     libwww-perl
     libdatetime-perl
     wget

  CRONJOB
  =======
  To set up the FM4 Trackservice Cronjob, 
  install the "trackservice.cron" Perl script
  somewhere in your home directory and add it
  to your crontab (crontab -e):

  */10 * * * * /home/thp/bin/trackservice.cron

  This would run the script every ten minutes.

  Don't forget to create the working directory 
  for the cronjob:   mkdir ~/.trackservice


  COMMANDLINE UTILITIES
  =====================
  
  1) fm4ts
  This script loads the current tracklist from 
  the FM4 Webserver and displays it on your 
  terminal.

  2) fm4ts-list
  This script reads the downloaded tracklist 
  cache and generates a list of "Artist - Song"
  lines that are then written to your terminal.

  3) fm4ts-search
  This script is a simple wrapper around the 
  fm4ts-list utility and grep to search for 
  specific songs or artists. Results are sent 
  to stdout.
